                        <strong>GareebGang</strong> isn't just a group; it’s a vibe. Starting from the classrooms of <strong>Watumull College</strong>, we are a group of friends who refuse to let college life be boring.

                        From random day-outs to planned trips that actually happen, we document our journey, share our unfiltered laughs, and build memories that last a lifetime. This platform is our digital home—a place to share our vlogs, photos, and future plans with the world.
